Apache Pig Philosophy
http://pig.apache.org/philosophy.html

What does it mean to be a pig?
The Apache Pig Project has some founding principles that help pig developers decide how the system should grow over time. This page presents those principles. 

Pigs Eat Anything
Pig can operate on data whether it has metadata or not. It can operate on data that is relational, nested, or unstructured. And it can easily be extended to operate on data beyond files, including key/value stores, databases, etc. 

Pigs Live Anywhere
Pig is intended to be a language for parallel data processing. It is not tied to one particular parallel framework. It has been implemented first on Hadoop, but we do not intend that to be only on Hadoop. 

Pigs Are Domestic Animals
Pig is designed to be easily controlled and modified by its users. 

Pig allows integration of user code where ever possible, so it currently supports user defined field transformation functions, user defined aggregates, and user defined conditionals. These functions can be written in Java or scripting languages that can compile down to Java (e.g. Jython). Pig supports user provided load and store functions. It supports external executables via its stream command and Map Reduce jars via its mapreduce command. It allows users to provide a custom partitioner for their jobs in some circumstances and to set the level of reduce parallelism for their jobs. command. It allows users to set the level of reduce parallelism for their jobs and in some circumstances to provide a custom partitioner. 

Pig has an optimizer that rearranges some operations in Pig Latin scripts to give better performance, combines Map Reduce jobs together, etc. However, users can easily turn this optimizer off to prevent it from making changes that do not make sense in their situation.

Storm
Distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation
http://storm-project.net
http://storm.incubator.apache.org
Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!

Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, and is easy to set up and operate.

Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed. Read more in the tutorial.

Pickle
Python object serialization
The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”, however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

The Nix project
http://nixos.org
Welcome to the homepage of the Nix project, which consists of a number of related open source subprojects:

Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it can ensure that an upgrade to one package cannot break others, that you can always roll back to previous version, that multiple versions of a package can coexist on the same system, and much more.

Nixpkgs is a large collection of packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.

NixOS is a Nix-based Linux distribution. Thanks to Nix, it supports atomic upgrades, rollbacks and multi-user package management, and it has a declarative approach to system configuration management that makes it easy to reproduce a configuration on another machine.

Hydra is a Nix-based continuous build system.

Disnix is a Nix-based distributed service deployment system.

XQL (XML Query Language)
http://www.ibiblio.org/xql/xql-proposal.html
Abstract

As more and more information is either stored in XML, exchanged in XML, or presented as XML through various interfaces, the ability to intelligently query our XML data sources becomes increasingly important. XML documents are structured documents – they blur the distinction between data and documents, allowing documents to be treated as data sources, and traditional data sources to be treated as documents.

IDEAS
https://ideas.repec.org/

What is IDEAS?
IDEAS the largest bibliographic database dedicated to Economics and available freely on the Internet. Based on RePEc, it indexes over 2,200,000 items of research, including over 2,000,000 that can be downloaded in full text.

This site is part of a large volunteer effort to enhance the free dissemination of research in Economics, RePEc, which includes bibliographic metadata from over 1,800 participating archives, including all the major publishers and research outlets. IDEAS is just one of several services that use RePEc data.

Authors are invited to register with RePEc to create an online profile. Then, anyone finding some of their research here can find your latest contact details and a listing of their other research. They will also receive a monthly mailing about the popularity of their works, their ranking and newly found citations. 




RePEc
http://repec.org/
RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 89 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related sciences. The heart of the project is a decentralized bibliographic database of working papers, journal articles, books, books chapters and software components, all maintained by volunteers. The collected data are then used in various services that serve the collected metadata to users or enhance it. 


The twelve-factor app (Metodology)
https://12factor.net/

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.


The Twelve Factors
I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. Config
Store config in the environment
IV. Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources
V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding
VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model
IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams
XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

Ref paper: 
A coverage analysis of Java benchmark suites (2005) 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.106.8389


Abstract

The Java programming language provides an almost ideal environment for both static and dynamic analysis, being easy to parse, and supporting a standardised, easily-profiled virtual environment. In this paper we study the relationship between results obtainable from static and dynamic analysis of Java programs, and in particular the difficulties of correlating static and dynamic results. As a foundation for this study, we focus on various criteria related to run-time code coverage, as commonly used in test suite analysis. We have implemented a dynamic coverage analysis tool for Java programs, and we use it to evaluate several standard Java benchmark suites using line, instruction and branch coverage criteria. We present data indicating a considerable variance in static and dynamic analysis results between these suites, and even between programs in these suites.

Sanctuary Cities

Def: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city

In the United States and Canada, a sanctuary city is a city that has adopted a policy of protecting illegal immigrants by not prosecuting them for violating federal immigration laws in the country in which they are now living illegally. Such a policy can be set out expressly in a law (de jure) or observed only in practice (de facto). The term applies generally to cities that do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce national immigration laws, and usually forbid police or municipal employees to inquire about a person's immigration status. The designation has no precise legal meaning.[1]

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a “City of Sanctuary” is a place that is committed to welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and others who are seeking safety. The movement is spread across over 80 towns, cities and local areas in England, Wales, Ireland including Northern Ireland and the Republic, and Scotland. The emphasis is on building bridges of connection and understanding, which is done through awareness raising, befriending schemes and forming cultural connections in the arts, sport, health, education, faith groups and other sectors of society.[2] Glasgow, Sheffield and Swansea are noted Cities of Sanctuary.[3][4]

BoundedContext 
https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html
Bounded Context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. It is the focus of DDD's strategic design section which is all about dealing with large models and teams. DDD deals with large models by dividing them into different Bounded Contexts and being explicit about their interrelationships.




Legacy Application Strangulation : Case Studies 
http://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/
Strangulation of a legacy or undesirable solution is a safe way to phase one thing our for something better, cheaper, or more expandable. You make something new that obsoletes a small percentage of something old, and put them live together. You do some more work in the same style, and go live again (rinse, repeat).
