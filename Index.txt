Apache Pig Philosophy
http://pig.apache.org/philosophy.html

What does it mean to be a pig?
The Apache Pig Project has some founding principles that help pig developers decide how the system should grow over time. This page presents those principles. 

Pigs Eat Anything
Pig can operate on data whether it has metadata or not. It can operate on data that is relational, nested, or unstructured. And it can easily be extended to operate on data beyond files, including key/value stores, databases, etc. 

Pigs Live Anywhere
Pig is intended to be a language for parallel data processing. It is not tied to one particular parallel framework. It has been implemented first on Hadoop, but we do not intend that to be only on Hadoop. 

Pigs Are Domestic Animals
Pig is designed to be easily controlled and modified by its users. 

Pig allows integration of user code where ever possible, so it currently supports user defined field transformation functions, user defined aggregates, and user defined conditionals. These functions can be written in Java or scripting languages that can compile down to Java (e.g. Jython). Pig supports user provided load and store functions. It supports external executables via its stream command and Map Reduce jars via its mapreduce command. It allows users to provide a custom partitioner for their jobs in some circumstances and to set the level of reduce parallelism for their jobs. command. It allows users to set the level of reduce parallelism for their jobs and in some circumstances to provide a custom partitioner. 

Pig has an optimizer that rearranges some operations in Pig Latin scripts to give better performance, combines Map Reduce jobs together, etc. However, users can easily turn this optimizer off to prevent it from making changes that do not make sense in their situation.

Storm
Distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation
http://storm-project.net
http://storm.incubator.apache.org
Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!

Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, and is easy to set up and operate.

Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed. Read more in the tutorial.

Pickle
Python object serialization
The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”, however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

The Nix project
http://nixos.org
Welcome to the homepage of the Nix project, which consists of a number of related open source subprojects:

Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it can ensure that an upgrade to one package cannot break others, that you can always roll back to previous version, that multiple versions of a package can coexist on the same system, and much more.

Nixpkgs is a large collection of packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.

NixOS is a Nix-based Linux distribution. Thanks to Nix, it supports atomic upgrades, rollbacks and multi-user package management, and it has a declarative approach to system configuration management that makes it easy to reproduce a configuration on another machine.

Hydra is a Nix-based continuous build system.

Disnix is a Nix-based distributed service deployment system.

Gradle is build automation evolved. Gradle can automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other types of projects such as generated static websites, generated documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

Automation Evolved
- Strong yet flexible conventions

XQL (XML Query Language)
http://www.ibiblio.org/xql/xql-proposal.html
Abstract

As more and more information is either stored in XML, exchanged in XML, or presented as XML through various interfaces, the ability to intelligently query our XML data sources becomes increasingly important. XML documents are structured documents – they blur the distinction between data and documents, allowing documents to be treated as data sources, and traditional data sources to be treated as documents.

Web Framework Benchmarks
Introduction
This is a performance comparison of many web application frameworks executing fundamental tasks such as JSON serialization, database access, and server-side template composition. Each framework is operating in a realistic production configuration. Results are captured on Amazon EC2 and on physical hardware. The test implementations are largely community-contributed and all source is available at the GitHub repository.

IDEAS
https://ideas.repec.org/

What is IDEAS?
IDEAS the largest bibliographic database dedicated to Economics and available freely on the Internet. Based on RePEc, it indexes over 2,200,000 items of research, including over 2,000,000 that can be downloaded in full text.

This site is part of a large volunteer effort to enhance the free dissemination of research in Economics, RePEc, which includes bibliographic metadata from over 1,800 participating archives, including all the major publishers and research outlets. IDEAS is just one of several services that use RePEc data.

Authors are invited to register with RePEc to create an online profile. Then, anyone finding some of their research here can find your latest contact details and a listing of their other research. They will also receive a monthly mailing about the popularity of their works, their ranking and newly found citations. 




RePEc
http://repec.org/
RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 89 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related sciences. The heart of the project is a decentralized bibliographic database of working papers, journal articles, books, books chapters and software components, all maintained by volunteers. The collected data are then used in various services that serve the collected metadata to users or enhance it. 


The twelve-factor app (Metodology)
https://12factor.net/

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps.


The Twelve Factors
I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. Config
Store config in the environment
IV. Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources
V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding
VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model
IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams
XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

Ref paper: 
A coverage analysis of Java benchmark suites (2005) 
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.106.8389


Abstract

The Java programming language provides an almost ideal environment for both static and dynamic analysis, being easy to parse, and supporting a standardised, easily-profiled virtual environment. In this paper we study the relationship between results obtainable from static and dynamic analysis of Java programs, and in particular the difficulties of correlating static and dynamic results. As a foundation for this study, we focus on various criteria related to run-time code coverage, as commonly used in test suite analysis. We have implemented a dynamic coverage analysis tool for Java programs, and we use it to evaluate several standard Java benchmark suites using line, instruction and branch coverage criteria. We present data indicating a considerable variance in static and dynamic analysis results between these suites, and even between programs in these suites.

Sanctuary Cities

Def: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city

In the United States and Canada, a sanctuary city is a city that has adopted a policy of protecting illegal immigrants by not prosecuting them for violating federal immigration laws in the country in which they are now living illegally. Such a policy can be set out expressly in a law (de jure) or observed only in practice (de facto). The term applies generally to cities that do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce national immigration laws, and usually forbid police or municipal employees to inquire about a person's immigration status. The designation has no precise legal meaning.[1]

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a “City of Sanctuary” is a place that is committed to welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and others who are seeking safety. The movement is spread across over 80 towns, cities and local areas in England, Wales, Ireland including Northern Ireland and the Republic, and Scotland. The emphasis is on building bridges of connection and understanding, which is done through awareness raising, befriending schemes and forming cultural connections in the arts, sport, health, education, faith groups and other sectors of society.[2] Glasgow, Sheffield and Swansea are noted Cities of Sanctuary.[3][4]

Legacy Application Strangulation : Case Studies 
http://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/
Strangulation of a legacy or undesirable solution is a safe way to phase one thing our for something better, cheaper, or more expandable. You make something new that obsoletes a small percentage of something old, and put them live together. You do some more work in the same style, and go live again (rinse, repeat).

JPA Performance Benchmark (JPAB)
http://www.jpab.org/
About this Benchmark

This is a comprehensive benchmark that compares the performance of different combinations of JPA providers and Database Management Systems (DBMS). It covers many JPA ORM providers (Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA and DataNucleus) and DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Derby, HSQLDB, H2, HSQLite) that are available in Java.

The benchmark is published by ObjectDB Software Ltd., but it should be useful also for anyone that is interested only in RDBMS and ORM (and not in object databases). Please read the FAQ for more details.

SAML-based products and services

REF: ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services

SAML 2.0
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0
Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) is a version of the SAML standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains. SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal (usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an Identity Provider, and a SAML consumer, named a Service Provider. SAML 2.0 enables web-based authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single sign-on (SSO), which helps reduce the administrative overhead of distributing multiple authentication tokens to the user.[1]

SAML 2.0 was ratified as an OASIS Standard in March 2005, replacing SAML 1.1. The critical aspects of SAML 2.0 are covered in detail in the official documents SAMLConform,[2] SAMLCore,[3] SAMLBind,[4] and SAMLProf.[5]

Serverless Architectures
https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html
By Mike Roberts
Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS"), the best known vendor host of which currently is AWS Lambda. By using these ideas, and by moving much behavior to the front end, such architectures remove the need for the traditional 'always on' server system sitting behind an application. Depending on the circumstances, such systems can significantly reduce operational cost and complexity at a cost of vendor dependencies and (at the moment) immaturity of supporting services.

Apollo - A platform for running your next generation web services and applications.
https://capgemini.github.io/devops/apollo/

An open-source platform for cloud native applications based on Apache Mesos and Docker.
github: https://github.com/Capgemini/Apollo

Features / Components

The following open source components are baked into Apollo core:

    Apache Mesos: The backbone of Apollo. Mesos handles cluster management and orchestration. Highly scalable and fault tolerant out of the box Mesos allows you to simplify the datacenter treating your cluster like one big machine. Mesos handles resource availability (CPU/memory/storage) and is able to distribute arbritrary tasks across your datacenter, making it ideal for big data workloads. http://mesos.apache.org

    Docker: For packaging and running your applications. We believe Docker will be a big player in the future of building and running applications in the enterprise. In combination with Mesos frameworks like Marathon and Aurora you can build your own platform as a service leveraging Linux containers. https://www.docker.com/

    Consul: For service discovery and DNS. Never hard-code an application endpoint or service URL in your configuration files again. We use Consul to automatically register service addresses, ports and arbritary information about Docker containers that start in the datacenter. It also comes packed with its own built-in DNS server so you can query services easily. https://www.consul.io/

    Weave: Weave simplifies the networking for Docker containers. We use Weave to create a separate overlay network which all containers start up in. This removes some of the headaches around Docker networking - no need to carefully co-ordinate which ports are mapped from host > container anymore. All containers inside the Weave network can communicate with each other directly using their Consul DNS and port meaning the end result looks a lot like standard networking (in the bare-metal / VM world). http://weave.works/

    Terraform: Terraform allows you to rapidly and consistently spin up resources in the cloud. Think Amazon Cloud Formation / OpenStack Heat but cloud agnostic. We’ve already built terraform plans that allow you to spin up Amazon VPC and Digitalocean public cloud. We’re looking to expand that with support for Rackspace(Openstack) and Microsoft Azure. https://www.terraform.io/

Main idea: "I hate installing things on my host and the files getting everywhere. I wanted the ability to delete an app and know it is gone fully without some random file hanging around. This gave me that. Not only that, I can control how much CPU and Memory the app uses. Yes, the cpu/memory hungry chrome is now perfectly contained!

“What?!?!”, you say. Let me show you.

The following covers a few of my favorite applications I run in containers. Each of the commands written below is actually pulled directly from my bash aliases. So you can have the same user experience as running one command today."

Technology Radar
https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar
By ThoughtWorks
Every six months or so, ThoughtWorks publishes its Technology Radar. What started as an interesting experiment has turned into quite a notable publication, which gets lots of attention from our clients and other netizens.

The radar is a document that sets out the changes that we think are currently interesting in software development - things in motion that we think you should pay attention to and consider using in your projects. It reflects the idiosyncratic opinion of a bunch of senior technologists based on our day-to-day work and experiences. While we think this is interesting, it should not be taken as a deep market analysis.

FAQ:
https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq



As the radar has made more and more of a splash, we run into common questions about it - why it has the format it has and how we come up with it. So we've put together this FAQ.

JIRA REST Java Client Library
https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JRJC/overview
Repo: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jira-rest-java-client 

About

JIRA REST Java Client is a Java library (usable from any JVM language) which allows to easily talk to any JIRA 4.2+ instance using new (and still evolving) REST API.

JRJC currently provides a thin layer of abstraction on top of REST API and related HTTP(S) communication. It provides a domain object model of JIRA entities on the client side - objects representing issues, priorities, resolutions, statuses, users, etc.

In the future though JRJC may be extended to handle things like caching (conditional GET, metadata) or provide a higher level of abstraction on top of existing REST API - completely shielding the user from the specifics of REST.

JRJC should be useful for integrating systems using JVM-based languages (like Java) with JIRA and specifically for integrating Atlassian products with themselves.

Introduction to HTML Applications (HTAs)
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536496%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
The power to build HTML Applications (HTAs) brings Windows Internet Explorer to the fore as a viable Windows development platform. HTAs are full-fledged applications. These applications are trusted and display only the menus, icons, toolbars, and title information that the web developer creates. In short, HTAs pack all the power of Internet Explorer—its object model, performance, rendering power and protocol support—without enforcing the strict security model and user interface of the browser.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-7
C# 7 adds a number of new features to the C# language:1
out variables:
You can declare out values inline as arguments to the method where they are used.
Tuples
You can create lightweight, unnamed types that contain multiple public fields. Compilers and IDE tools understand the semantics of these types.
Pattern Matching
You can create branching logic based on arbitrary types and values of the members of those types.
ref locals and returns
Method arguments and local variables can be references to other storage.
Local Functions
You can nest functions inside other functions to limit their scope and visibility.
More expression-bodied members
The list of members that can be authored using expressions has grown.
throw Expressions
You can throw exceptions in code constructs that previously were not allowed because throw was a statement.
Generalized async return types
Methods declared with the async modifier can return other types in addition to Task and Task<T>.
Numeric literal syntax improvements
New tokens improve readability for numeric constants.
The remainder of this topic discusses each of the features. For each feature, you'll learn the reasoning behind it. You'll learn the syntax. You'll see some sample scenarios where using the new feature will make you more productive as a developer.

RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language)
https://raml.org/
The simplest way to design APIs
RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing. It's concise - you only write what you need to define - and reusable. It is machine readable API design that is actually human friendly. 

REST is used in the context of an API implemented using some or all of the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), which was introduced and first defined in 2000 in Chapter 5, REST, of the doctoral dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" by Roy Fielding.

Shibboleth (Internet2)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(Internet2)
https://shibboleth.net/
Shibboleth is a standards based, open source software package for web single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries. It allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.
The Shibboleth software implements widely used federated identity standards, principally the OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), to provide a federated single sign-on and attribute exchange framework. A user authenticates with his or her organizational credentials, and the organization (or identity provider) passes the minimal identity information necessary to the service provider to enable an authorization decision. Shibboleth also provides extended privacy functionality allowing a user and their home site to control the attributes released to each application.
The Shibboleth project began as an Internet2 Middleware activity in 2000, and later that year the project connected with the work of the OASIS SAML Working Group. Shibboleth 1.0 was released in 2003, and was quickly adopted by research and education communities worldwide. With SAML 2.0 in 2005 and Shibboleth 2.0 the following year, the SAML standards grew to include all the multi-lateral, metadata driven approaches pioneered by Shibboleth.
Shibboleth is developed as open source software and is released under the Apache Software License. More information about the individual components is available on the Products page.

Shibboleth® is a registered trademark of Internet2®.

About:
http://shpe.org/about
History

The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic community.
The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.
Mission & Vision

Mission

SHPE changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development.
Vision

SHPE's vision is a world where Hispanics are highly valued and influential as the leading innovators, scientists, mathematicians and engineers.

The OWASP Foundation
The OWASP Foundation came online on December 1st 2001 it was established as a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States on April 21, 2004 to ensure the ongoing availability and support for our work at OWASP. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at www.owasp.org.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative and open way. The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success.

RocksDB | A persistent key-value store 
rocksdb.org
RocksDB is an embeddable persistent key-value store for fast storage.
Repo: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/

The RocksDB library provides a persistent key value store. Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. The keys are ordered within the key value store according to a user-specified comparator function.

The library is maintained by the Facebook Database Engineering Team, and is based on LevelDB, by Sanjay Ghemawat and Jeff Dean at Google.

This overview gives some simple examples of how RocksDB is used. For the story of why RocksDB was created in the first place, see Dhruba Borthakur’s introductory talk from the Data @ Scale 2013 conference.





Multi-Tenant Benchmarking Tool (MTBT)
https://github.com/linkedin/MTBT
Multi-tenant Benchmarking Tool (MTBT) is a Java-based key-value store benchmarking tool. As the name suggests, it is multi-tenant (i.e., you can create multiple jobs with different parameters), and workload-dynamic (i.e., you can issue changes to the workload for a particular job throughout the execution). The most important features of MTBT are:

    Multi-process: Multiple MTBT processes can co-ordinate to execute a given work plan. One of the processes is designated as the master, while the remaining ones are called the slaves. Master coordinates the overall execution by sharing the work plan and synchronizing processes, and combines the final result collected by each MTBT process.
    
	Multi-tenant: Multiple jobs can be defined, each having its own parameters (e.g., number of queries per second, query ratios, etc.).
    
	Dynamic: Given a run time for the experiment, you can schedule changes to the throughput (i.e., queries per second) of any job.
    
	Extensible: In order to benchmark a new database system, you can implement necessary MTBT interfaces and execute core MTBT functionality for your particular test case.


	
	
	
Project Grizzly
NIO Event Development Simplified	
https://javaee.github.io/grizzly/
repo: https://github.com/javaee/grizzly 	
	
Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming language has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API (NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to scale to thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to help developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API. Grizzly’s goal is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO as well as offering extended framework components: Web Framework (HTTP/S), WebSocket, Comet, and more!

QuickCheck
http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/
QuickCheck is a tool for testing Haskell programs automatically. The programmer provides a specification of the program, 
in the form of properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number
 of randomly generated cases. Specifications are expressed in Haskell, using combinators defined in the QuickCheck library.
 QuickCheck provides combinators to define properties, observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.

Apache Druid (incubating)
http://druid.io/
Apache Druid (incubating) is a high performance analytics data store for event-driven data.
GIT: https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid

Overview

Druid is primarily used to store, query, and analyze large event streams. Examples of event streams include user generated data such as clickstreams, application generated data such as performance metrics, and machine generated data such as network flows and server metrics. Druid is optimized for sub-second queries to slice-and-dice, drill down, search, filter, and aggregate this data. Druid is commonly used to power interactive applications where performance, concurrency, and uptime are important.

Druid was initially created to power a scalable, visual, multi-tenant application where users could not only rapidly slice and dice data to create ad-hoc reports, but also interactively explore data to quickly determine the root cause of patterns and anomalies. Druid is designed from the ground up for sub-second queries, which are critical in interactive applications as usability studies have shown that humans get distracted and lose their train of thought if responses take longer than a second.

Java Pub House
http://www.javapubhouse.com/
Nominated as the winner for the Ultimate List of Developer Podcast (for Java) we are the best source for Java Topics for the Professional Software Developer and the serious enthusiast! This podcast started with a simple idea. After interviewing all day long for a budding Startup, Freddy noticed that a lot of candidates came in with some strangely warped concepts on multi-threading, garbage collection and/or software design. As he went through the internet he realized that there are a lot of podcasts and beginning tutorials for a budding Java Developer, but there wasn’t a podcast that dealt with the real problems that a Java Developer encounters in their day-to-day job. Things like “how to troubleshoot a deadlock“, to “Optimizing for Performance” were never discussed with clarity, so Freddy set out to create a brand new podcast that will tackle “real issues” on “production software”. We don’t need another “hello world” podcast, but instead, we want to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of using the console for logging output!

How to properly update the Gradle wrapper
https://blog.nishtahir.com/2018/04/15/how-to-properly-update-the-gradle-wrapper/
The Gradle wrapper is a self-contained Gradle runner and distribution that's typically built into your Gradle project. It's bundled into the project is to guarantee that all developers working on the project have a similar build environment. This means that updating the Gradle wrapper is effectively bumping up the Gradle version for the entire team.

	List of Generic Fall-back Excuses

	For any piece of code the following excuses are usually applicable. Feel free to use any at random or in order. Remember to cycle though them over time to avoid your excuses being picked up.

		The code is too complex to unit test.
		The code is too simple to unit test.
		There’s no point unit testing code that doesn’t change.
		This is a destructive process, so it cannot be unit tested.
		Unit tests won’t tell me if this code actually works.
		That code is side effect free so there is no need to test it.
		It would be too slow to test that code due to the dependencies.
		I can test this more quickly manually.
		The client is paying for a deliverable not unit tests.
		Thats QA’s problem.
		Unit tests are just assertions in disguise.
		Unit testing was a staple of the FORTRAN days.
		Unit testing is not about finding bugs.
		Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. - Bill Gates
		There is an exception to every rule, and we must of course be flexible.
		Never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by incompetence. - Napoleon
		Testing is for communists.
		Unit tests cause autism.
		I am the only developer on the project.
		It’s an internal only tool.
		The sole user of this is me.
		Unit tests are anti-agile.

Primitive Obsession
https://www.devteams.at/2019/02/04/primitive-obsession.html
by David Tanzer
https://www.devteams.at/

Did you ever see some piece of code that uses primitive data types, like Strings or integers,
 in it’s public API? I am sure you have, because most code is written like that.

But that can cause problems. Today, I want to talk about a code smell called “Primitive Obsession”.
 And I want to show you how code often becomes easier to understand and “nicer” 
 by eliminating primitive data types - especially, but not only, from it’s public API.

Design patterns implemented in Java	
https://java-design-patterns.com/
Repo: https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns

	Introduction

	Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

	Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

	Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

Creating Mock Objects for C# Unit Tests, using Moq
https://scottlilly.com/creating-mock-objects-for-c-unit-tests-using-moq/
In my demonstration of the Dependency Injection design pattern, I manually created a mock object. This let me perform unit tests without needing to access a database.
Here is how you can use the Moq library, to eliminate writing the code for manual mock classes.
If you aren’t familiar with dependency injection, please read this article first




Golden Rule
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regla_de_oro_(%C3%A9tica)
The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in many religions and cultures.[1][2]

The Golden Rule can be considered an ethic of reciprocity in some religions, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:

    One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (positive or directive form).
    One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated (negative or prohibitive form).[1]
    What you wish upon others, you wish upon yourself (empathic or responsive form).[1]

The idea dates at least to the early Confucian times (551–479 BC) according to Rushworth Kidder, who identifies that this concept appears prominently in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, and "the rest of the world's major religions".[3] The concept of the Rule is codified in the Code of Hammurabi stele and tablets, 1754-1790 BC. 143 leaders encompassing the world's major faiths endorsed the Golden Rule as part of the 1993 "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic", including the Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian.[4][5] According to Greg M. Epstein, " 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely," but belief in God is not necessary to endorse it.[6] Simon Blackburn also states that the Golden Rule can be "found in some form in almost every ethical tradition".[7]

Yet, as with any historically prominent maxim, the Golden Rule is not without its controversy (as seen in the Criticism section below).

CodeCity
http://wettel.github.io/codecity.html
By Richard Wettel
Welcome to CodeCity!
CodeCity is an integrated environment for software analysis, in which software systems are visualized as interactive, navigable 3D cities. The classes are represented as buildings in the city, while the packages are depicted as the districts in which the buildings reside. The visible properties of the city artifacts depict a set of chosen software metrics, as in the polymetric views of CodeCrawler.

You can read more about my approach in the ICPC 2007, VISSOFT 2007, Softvis 2008, WASDett 2008, WCRE 2008, FAMOOSr 2008 papers and the ICSE 2008 tool demo on my Publications page. If you would rather prefer a hands-on learning process, download CodeCity, run it, and tell me what you think. I appreciate every piece of feedback I get. CodeCity is programmed in VisualWorks Smalltalk on top of the Moose platform, uses OpenGL for rendering, and runs on every major platform. To see CodeCity in action visit the Wall of Fame. Here is a sneak preview with a CodeCity visualization of JDK (Java Development Kit) v1.5:




Zipkin
https://zipkin.io/
https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin
https://zipkin.io/pages/architecture.html

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkin’s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

Applications are instrumented to report timing data to Zipkin. The Zipkin UI also presents a Dependency diagram showing how many traced requests went through each application. If you are troubleshooting latency problems or errors, you can filter or sort all traces based on the application, length of trace, annotation, or timestamp. Once you select a trace, you can see the percentage of the total trace time each span takes which allows you to identify the problem application.

Centralized configuration with Spring Cloud Config
https://zoltanaltfatter.com/2016/06/30/centralized-configuration-with-spring-cloud-config/
By 
Zoltan Altfatter

In this blog post I am looking into Spring Cloud Config project which is a great tool for centralized 
configuration management in a microservice environment. I have prepared a simple example project 
which you can find on my github account. It contains a config-service leveraging Spring Cloud 
Config Server and three little services using Spring Cloud Config Client. 




Jib
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib

Jib builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon -
and without deep mastery of Docker best-practices. 
It is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle and as a Java library.

Maven: See documentation for jib-maven-plugin.
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/jib-maven-plugin
Gradle: See documentation for jib-gradle-plugin.
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/jib-gradle-plugin
Jib Core: A general-purpose container-building library for Java.
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/jib-core




Testcontainers
Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.
https://www.testcontainers.org/
Testcontainers make the following kinds of tests easier:

Data access layer integration tests: use a containerized instance of a MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle database to test your data access layer code for complete compatibility, but without requiring complex setup on developers' machines and safe in the knowledge that your tests will always start with a known DB state. Any other database type that can be containerized can also be used.
Application integration tests: for running your application in a short-lived test mode with dependencies, such as databases, message queues or web servers.
UI/Acceptance tests: use containerized web browsers, compatible with Selenium, for conducting automated UI tests. Each test can get a fresh instance of the browser, with no browser state, plugin variations or automated browser upgrades to worry about. And you get a video recording of each test session, or just each session where tests failed.




Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet

https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user’s web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. A CSRF attack works because browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user's session cookie, IP address, etc. Therefore, if the user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between the forged or legitimate request sent by the victim. We would need a token/identifier that is not accessible to attacker and would not be sent along (like cookies) with forged requests that attacker initiates. For more information on CSRF, see OWASP Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) page.




Threat Modeling

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling

Threat modeling is a core element of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). It’s an engineering technique you can use to help you identify threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures that could affect your application. You can use threat modeling to shape your application's design, meet your company's security objectives, and reduce risk.

There are five major threat modeling steps:
 Defining security requirements. 
 Creating an application diagram. 
 Identifying threats. 
 Mitigating threats. 
 Validating that threats have been mitigated. 
Threat modeling should be part of your routine development lifecycle, enabling you to progressively refine your threat model and further reduce risk.




List of cognitive biases
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases

1	Decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases
2	Social biases
3	Memory errors and biases

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics.

Although the reality of these biases is confirmed by replicable research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.

The Mission
We are a small team of tech savvy people who just love to keep up with the latest technology inventions. 
Be it computer, mobile phones, applications or any other software, we just want to test everything.
We try to find out how to make the best use of a particular product. 
In our ventures, we have also tried to figure out ways of making things work. 
Whenever we wanted to achieve some goal, first we used to search for a solution on the one place everybody looks for – the Internet. 
Yeah, sometimes we did find solution there, but at other times when we didn’t, we tried our own ways to find a suitable alternative. 
And if we were lucky enough, a solution would be discovered.

ScrapBook Pages
https://veerasundar.com/blog/2009/10/eclipse-tip-how-to-use-scrapbook-pages-in-eclipse/

So, what is Scrapbook Page? To put it simply, 
it’s just a file where you can place your Java code snippet and execute it directly from the Scrapbook. 
No need to create any temperory classes (like I did in the previous para). 
You can even put one line of Java statement like System.out.println(‘Hello’) in the Scrapbook and execute it. 
You’ll get the ‘Hello’ printed on your console. Cool, Isn’t it?

File -> New -> Other -> Java -> Java Run/Debug -> Scrapbook page.

RAMCloud
https://github.com/PlatformLab/RAMCloud

What is RAMCloud?

RAMCloud is a new class of super-high-speed storage for large-scale datacenter applications. 
It is designed for applications in which a large number of servers in a datacenter need low-latency access to a large durable datastore. 
RAMCloud offers the following properties:

    Low latency: RAMCloud keeps all data in DRAM at all times, so applications can read RAMCloud objects remotely over a datacenter network in as little as 5μs. Writes take less than 15μs. Unlike systems such as memcached, applications never have to deal with cache misses or wait for disk/flash accesses. As a result, RAMCloud storage is 10-1000x faster than other available alternatives.
    Large scale: RAMCloud aggregates the DRAM of thousands of servers to support total capacities of 1PB or more.
    Durability: RAMCloud replicates all data on nonvolatile secondary storage such as disk or flash, so no data is lost if servers crash or the power fails. One of RAMCloud's unique features is that it recovers very quickly from server crashes (only 1-2 seconds) so the availability gaps after crashes are almost unnoticeable. As a result, RAMCloud combines the durability of replicated disk with the speed of DRAM. If you have used memcached, you have probably experienced the challenges of managing a second durable storage system and maintaining consistency between it and memcached. With RAMCloud, there is no need for a second storage system.
    Powerful data model: RAMCloud's basic data model is a key-value store, but we have extended it with several additional features, such as:
        Multiple tables, each with its own key space.
        Transactional updates that span multiple objects in different tables.
        Secondary indices.
        Strong consistency: unlike other NoSQL storage systems, all updates in RAMCloud are consistent, immediately visible, and durable.
    Easy deployment: RAMCloud is a software package that runs on commodity Intel servers with the Linux operating system. RAMCloud is available freely in open source form.

Tilt 
https://tilt.dev/
Tilt Up and Get Stuff Done
Tilt manages local development instances for teams that deploy to Kubernetes.

	Transition easily from any setup
		Tilt is super fast to set up for greenfield projects, but it really shines when your setup requires some “extra love”
		(and even then it’s still pretty quick!) Any setup, any architecture, no matter how complex. Any engineer can run tilt up to see the app live instantly.
		

	Update services quickly
		Tilt watches your filesystem and updates your servers in seconds so you can spend more time getting stuff done and less time watching paint dry. 
		Tilt makes even the most complicated setups feel snappy again — and that’s no easy task.
		> Get more stuff done 

	See problems instantly
		Stop playing 20 questions with kubectl each time your app misbehaves. Tilt collects problems from across tools and services into one UI. 
		One place to see build breakages, yaml typos, crash loops, and request exceptions.
		> Waste less time tracking down issues

The Art of Computer Programming 
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html
 
 >> The bible of all fundamental algorithms and the work that taught many of today’s software developers

 >> —Byte, September 1995
 
ISBN-13: 978-0321751041
ISBN-10: 0321751043 

Ref: https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/#comments

	Knuth eventually merged his dual loves of discrete digital problems and large collections of information in his magnum opus, The Art of Computer Programming — a book series he began writing as a graduate student in 1962 and has yet to complete. He published volume 1 in 1968, and the current version is in its 42nd printing. Volume 2 followed in 1969 and volume 3 in 1973. By then he was a computer science professor at Stanford University, but he worried that his work would prevent him from completing his books. So he took a leave of absence in 1990 and then retired in 1993 to spend the rest of his life completing the seven-volume set. Now 82, he’s hard at work on part B of volume 4, and he anticipates that the book will have at least parts A through F.

https://sequencediagram.org
SequenceDiagram.org is an online tool / software for creating UML sequence diagrams. Founded in 2014 with the purpose to improve the efficiency when 
creating and working with sequence diagrams by combining text notation scripting and drawing by clicking and dragging in the same model.
All parsing, processing, and drawing are done client side. The benefit of this is that SequenceDiagram.org is fast and convenient to work with;
it also doesn’t transfer your diagram data over the Internet like many other sequence diagram tools on the market. 
This also means that it is possible to work with the tool offline.
The tool is developed, maintained, and used by people who create a lot of sequence diagrams in their daily work. 
If you have any question/comments /suggestions/bugs please contact info@sequencediagram.org. The more feedback we get the better we can prioritize.

FAQ:
Is the codebase of SequenceDiagram.org open source?
The codebase is currently not available under any open source license

7 Popular Unit Test Naming Conventions
https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming

	1. MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior: There are arguments against this strategy that if method names change as part of code refactoring 	than test name like this should also change or it becomes difficult to comprehend at a later stage. Following are some of the example:
		isAdult_AgeLessThan18_False
		withdrawMoney_InvalidAccount_ExceptionThrown
		admitStudent_MissingMandatoryFields_FailToAdmit
	2. MethodName_ExpectedBehavior_StateUnderTest: Slightly tweeked from above, but a section of developers also recommend using this naming technique. This technique also has disadvantage that if method names get changed, it becomes difficult to comprehend at a later stage. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
		isAdult_False_AgeLessThan18
		withdrawMoney_ThrowsException_IfAccountIsInvalid
		admitStudent_FailToAdmit_IfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
	3. test[Feature being tested]: This one makes it easy to read the test as the feature to be tested is written as part of test name. Although, there are arguments that the “test” prefix is redundant. However, some sections of developer love to use this technique. Following is how the above tests would read like if named using this technique:
		testIsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18
		testFailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid
		testStudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
	4. Feature to be tested: Many suggests that it is better to simply write the feature to be tested because one is anyway using annotations to identify method as test methods. It is also recommended for the reason that it makes unit tests as alternate form of documentation and avoid code smells. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
		IsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18
		FailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid
		StudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
	5. Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest: This technique is also used by many as it makes it easy to read the tests. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
		Should_ThrowException_When_AgeLessThan18
		Should_FailToWithdrawMoney_ForInvalidAccount
		Should_FailToAdmit_IfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
	6. When_StateUnderTest_Expect_ExpectedBehavior: Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
		When_AgeLessThan18_Expect_isAdultAsFalse
		When_InvalidAccount_Expect_WithdrawMoneyToFail
		When_MandatoryFieldsAreMissing_Expect_StudentAdmissionToFail
	7. Given_Preconditions_When_StateUnderTest_Then_ExpectedBehavior: This approach is based on naming convention developed as part of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). The idea is to break down the tests into three part such that one could come up with preconditions, state under test and expected behavior to be written in above format. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
		Given_UserIsAuthenticated_When_InvalidAccountNumberIsUsedToWithdrawMoney_Then_TransactionsWillFail

Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data
www.gisaid.org
Mision:
Enabling rapid and open access to epidemic and pandemic virus data

The GISAID Initiative promotes the rapid sharing of data from all influenza viruses and the coronavirus causing COVID-19. This includes genetic sequence and related clinical and epidemiological data associated with human viruses, and geographical as well as species-specific data associated with avian and other animal viruses, to help researchers understand how viruses evolve and spread during epidemics and pandemics.

GISAID does so by overcoming disincentive hurdles and restrictions, which discourage or prevented sharing of virological data prior to formal publication.

The Initiative ensures that open access to data in GISAID is provided free-of-charge to all individuals that agreed to identify themselves and agreed to uphold the GISAID sharing mechanism governed through its Database Access Agreement.

All bonafide users with GISAID access credentials agreed to the basic premise of upholding a scientific etiquette, by acknowledging the Originating laboratories providing the specimens, and the Submitting laboratories generating sequence and other metadata, ensuring fair exploitation of results derived from the data, and that all users agree that no restrictions shall be attached to data submitted to GISAID, to promote collaboration among researchers on the basis of open sharing of data and respect for all rights and interests.

Clean URL (slug)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug
Clean URLs, also sometimes referred to as RESTful URLs, user-friendly URLs, or search engine-friendly URLs, are Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) intended to improve the usability and accessibility of a website or web service by being immediately and intuitively meaningful to non-expert users. Such URL schemes tend to reflect the conceptual structure of a collection of information and decouple the user interface from a server's internal representation of information. Other reasons for using clean URLs include search engine optimization (SEO),[1] conforming to the representational state transfer (REST) style of software architecture, and ensuring that individual web resources remain consistently at the same URL. This makes the World Wide Web a more stable and useful system, and allows more durable and reliable bookmarking of web resources

Some systems define a slug as the part of a URL that identifies a page in human-readable keywords.[4][5] It is usually the end part of the URL, which can be interpreted as the name of the resource, similar to the basename in a filename or the title of a page. The name is based on the use of the word slug in the news media to indicate a short name given to an article for internal use. 




HyperSQL
http://hsqldb.org/
HSQLDB - 100% Java Database

HSQLDB is a mature product. Versions released in recent years have enhanced reliability and performance.

Version 2.5.0 followed the 2.4.x releases with improvements in all areas and better support for new Java versions.

Background

HyperSQL is developed and published by the The HSQL Development Group. The group was formed in 2001 and has released several major new versions of the database over the years. 

Version 2.0 was released in 2010 with a brand new transactional core engine and JDBC implementation. 

The engine has been developed much further in version 2.5.0.

Direct downloads from SourceForge exceed 2,000,000 copies, with hundreds of millions of copies distributed as part of other software packages.

HyperSQL was selected as the SourceForge Project of the Month for January 2012. An interview with core developers is published here. 




MBeans - Introduction
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/index.html
This lesson introduces the fundamental concept of the JMX API, namely managed beans, or MBeans.

An MBean is a managed Java object, similar to a JavaBeans component, that follows the design patterns set forth in the JMX specification. An MBean can represent a device, an application, or any resource that needs to be managed. MBeans expose a management interface that consists of the following:

    A set of readable or writable attributes, or both.
    A set of invokable operations.
    A self-description.

The management interface does not change throughout the life of an MBean instance. MBeans can also emit notifications when certain predefined events occur.

The JMX specification defines five types of MBean:

    Standard MBeans
    Dynamic MBeans
    Open MBeans
    Model MBeans
    MXBeans

The examples in this trail demonstrate only the simplest types of MBean, namely standard MBeans and MXBeans.

javalin
https://javalin.io/
A simple web framework for Java and Kotlin
https://github.com/tipsy/javalin

	Simple
		Unlike other Java and Kotlin web frameworks, Javalin has very few concepts that you need to learn. You never extend classes and you rarely implement interfaces.

	Lightweight
		Javalin is just a few thousand lines of code on top of Jetty, and its performance is equivalent to raw Jetty code. Due to its size, it's very easy to reason about the source code.

	Interoperable
		Other Java and Kotlin web frameworks usually offer separate version for each language. Javalin is being developed with interoperability in mind, so apps are built the same way in both Java and Kotlin.

	Flexible
		Javalin is designed to be simple and blocking, as this is the easiest programming model to reason about. However, if you set a Future as a result, Javalin switches into asynchronous mode.

	Educational
		Visit our educators page if you're teaching web programming and looking for a web framework which will get out of your way and let you focus on the core concepts of your curriculum.

	OpenAPI integration
		Many lightweight Java and Kotlin web frameworks don't support OpenAPI, but Javalin has a full integration, including Swagger UI and redoc to display the generate docs. Learn more at the dedicated OpenAPI plugin page.

Nowadays, front-end and back-end components often separate a web application. Usually, we expose APIs as a back-end component for the front-end component or third-party app integrations.

In such a scenario, it is essential to have proper specifications for the back-end APIs. At the same time, the API documentation should be informative, readable, and easy to follow.

Approaches to Achieve in-Memory Table Storage with PostgreSQL Pluggable API 	
https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/24/approaches-to-achieve-in-memory-table-storage-with-postgresql-pluggable-api
1. Introduction
Recently, I have had an opportunity to perform some in-depth feasibility study in-memory table using PostgreSQL’s pluggable storage API. The pluggable storage API was introduced Since PostgreSQL v12 and it allowed custom table storage Access Methods (AM for short) to be developed. Some famous examples include zheap from EDB, which aims to store a much more simplified tuple structure to achieve vacuum free storage and zedstore from Greenplum to utilize columnar storage. But they do not utilize in-memory storage and still interacts with existing buffer manager to persist data to disk.
Yes, it would be nice to have in-memory tables if they would perform faster. It would definitely be a very interesting challenge if we could achieve an in-memory table storage engine and design it in a way that will give serious performance advantages using the existing pluggable storage API architecture.
Developing a custom storage AM is no easy task and it requires a very deep understanding on how the current PostgreSQL storage engine works before we are able to improve it. In addition to redefining the tuple structure and custom algorithms to store and retrieve, it is also possible to define our own in-memory based storage module to handle the insertion and retrieval of tuple instead of utilizing the same buffer manager routines like what heap, zheap and zedstore access methods are using.
In this blog, I will briefly talk about the capability of pluggable storage API and share some progress on our in-memory table analysis

	Tools

		JavaTest/JT Harness
		• JT Harness project : http://jtharness.java.net/
		• Download page : http://download.java.net/jtharness/download.html
		• Documentation : http://jtharness.java.net/jt_docs.html
		JT harness is the open source version of the JavaTest harness. JT harness is a general purpose, fully-featured, flexible, and configurable test harness very well suited for most types of unit testing, especially TCK test suites. The JT harness is an excellent tool for configuring, sequencing, and running test suites that consist of large numbers of discrete, independent tests. It is especially good at testing APIs and compilers. Originally developed as a test harness to run the JCK test suite, it has since evolved into a general purpose test platform well suited for use with all TCK test suites and other types of test suites.

	Documentation

		TCK Project Planning and Development Guide
		http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/TCK-docs/ppg.pdf
		Provides an overview and starting point for an Expert Group responsible for developing a technology compatibility kit (TCK) under the Java Community Process program. It is a high-level planning guide for project managers.

		Java Technology Test Suite Development Guide
		http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/TCK-docs/tsdg.pdf
		Describes in detail how to design and write TCK tests and to build a TCK.
		The Sample TCK tests mentioned in this document are available for download here.

		Java Technology Compatibility Kit User's Guide Template
		http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/TCK-docs/tck_ug_template.pdf
		Provides an outline and template that can be used as the basis for creating a complete User's Guide for a TCK.
		NOTE: this template assumes that your TCK will be built with the JT Harness and is therefore considerably more complex than might be necessary for your purposes. For a simpler template see the next item.

		Simplified TCK User's Guide Template
		http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/TCK-docs/simple_template.pdf
		Provides a simple template that can be used as the basis for creating a User's Guide for a TCK. Because the template contains sample Compatibility Requirements it will be particuarly helpful in ensuring that your TCK meets the requirements of the JCP's Process Document.

		Sample Test Coverage Document
		http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/TCK-docs/Sample-TCD.html
		Provides a sample Test Coverage Document (TCD) that can be used as a model for the TCD that you deliver to the PMO with the final version of your TCK.

Fastify
https://www.fastify.io/
Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js

	Why

		An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy users. How can you efficiently handle the resources of your server, knowing that you are serving the highest number of requests possible, without sacrificing security validations and handy development?

		Enter Fastify. Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture. It is inspired by Hapi and Express and as far as we know, it is one of the fastest web frameworks in town.


	Core features

	These are the main features and principles on which fastify has been built:

		Highly performant: as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 30 thousand requests per second.
		Extendible: Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins and decorators.
		Schema based: even if it is not mandatory we recommend to use JSON Schema to validate your routes and serialize your outputs, internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant function.
		Logging: logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best logger to almost remove this cost, Pino!
		Developer friendly: the framework is built to be very expressive and to help developers in their daily use, without sacrificing performance and security.
		TypeScript ready: we work hard to maintain a TypeScript type declaration file so we can support the growing TypeScript community.
